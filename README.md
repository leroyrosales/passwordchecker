# Password Checker

This small app will let you run a script locally in order to securely check your password. In your terminal simply run:

```
python3 passwordchecker.py [PASSWORD]
```

The script will run and show you if the password has been found using the API available at [https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
